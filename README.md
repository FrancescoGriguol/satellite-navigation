# ðŸ“¡ Satellite Navigation â€“ MATLAB Projects

This repository contains the MATLAB-based exercises and data from the *Satellite Navigation* course. Each `Workshop` folder corresponds to a specific laboratory session or assignment, focused on key topics in GNSS and satellite-based positioning.

## ðŸ“š Contents

| Folder       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Workshop_1` | 2D GPS positioning and error analysis with and without weighting |
| `Workshop_2` | Satellite orbit computation using broadcast and precise ephemerides |
| `Workshop_3_8` | GNSS data parsing and standard point positioning with SwiftNav receiver |
| `Workshop_4` | CA-code acquisition and tracking of GPS L1 signals |
| `Workshop_5` | Kalman filter implementation for a low-dynamic GPS receiver |
| `Workshop_6` | Direct Kalman filter for GNSS/INS integration |
| `Workshop_7` | Satellite positioning and orbit determination using real GNSS data |

> ðŸ“Œ Some folders contain raw data collected with SwiftNav GNSS receivers and MATLAB scripts for orbit propagation, signal tracking, and positioning.
